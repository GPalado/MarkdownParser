<h1>This is my markdown file Header1</h1>
<p>
Now here's a paragraph - I really hope that this works, because if not then that's super awkward and I mean awkward.
It would make me really sad if this wasn't part of the above paragraph...
</p>
<ul>
<li>And if this bulleted list line didn't work</li>
<li>And this line too</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>How about this numbered list line?</li>
<li>And this one?</li>
</ol>
<p>
I'm really hoping this is a paragraph...
If not...
Sad life...
</p>
<h2>This should be a header2</h2>
<p>
######## This should not be a header
</p>
<hr>
<p>
That above horizontal rule is nice, no?

<blockquote>
<p>
Ayyyyy blockquotes
