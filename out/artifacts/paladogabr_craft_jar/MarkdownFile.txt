# This is my markdown file Header1
Now here's a paragraph - I really hope that this works, because if not then that's super awkward and I mean awkward.
It would make me really sad if this wasn't part of the above paragraph...
* And if this bulleted list line didn't work
* And this line too
1. How about this numbered list line?
1. And this one?

I'm really hoping this is a paragraph...
If not...
Sad life...
## This should be a header2
######## This should not be a header

That above horizontal rule is nice, no?
